# Digital Twin Builder Project

Work by Max Bastida, in partnership with Edward Wong, and supervised by Ben Adams

The purpose of this project is to investigate the development of an application to show 3D scenes generated from LiDAR scans and satellite imagery. This is undertaken as a SENG402 software engineering project at the University of Canterbury, in partnership with Eagle.
